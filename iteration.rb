#program 1:)
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
for i in array
  puts i
end

# In this above program iteration method is used for repeatation of a process. eg:) for array=[1,2,3,4,5] the output is 1,2,3,4,5 !!  



#program 2:)
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
array.each do |i|
  puts i
end

# array.each method accepts a block to which each element of the array is passed in turn !!
