puts 4+3 # special operator methods like +,-,*,/,[] etc, we can add,sub, mul, div, <> etc. eg:) 4+3=7. 

puts 5*6 # same comment as above but here it performs multiply operation.

puts 6**2 # here it performs 6 power 2 operation ie., 6*6=36.
 # conclusion : As understand special methods are used for convenience of developer, i mean instead using puts.add(number), one can access directly using +,-,*,/ methods!!

Words = ["Apple", "Mango", "pomogranate"]  # In ruby values start from 0,1,2.... hence if we give '0' in puts "Apple" is printed as output. Similarly it carryon....
